# Problem is - 
<!-- 
Consider the following data structure.

const accountBalanceHistory = [
  {
    monthNumber: 0, // current month
    account: {
      balance: { amount: 0 },
    },
  },
  {
    monthNumber: 1, // last month
    account: {
      balance: { amount: 100 },
    },
  },
  {
    monthNumber: 2, // two months ago
    account: {
      balance: { amount: 200 },
    },
  }
]
Account balance history is an array that denotes a monthly track record of the balance in someone's account (or simply put how much money they had left that month!)

Each top level object within the array denotes the running balance value within that particular month.

E.g. in our example above, I can see that someone started of with a balance of 200 2 months ago, this decreased to 100 the following month, and again to 0 in the final and current month.
